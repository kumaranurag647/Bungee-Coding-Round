# Bungee-Coding-Round
-> C++ programming language has been used to solve the coding problem.
-> Follow the steps below to get the desired result :-

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make the OUTPUT folder empty by deleting the already present .csv files (Don't touch the INPUT folder i.e. main.csv).
3. Run the sourceCode.cpp  file using any C++ compiler (It has been tested on Visual Studio to test everything).
4. The OUPUT folder will again get populated with the desired .csv files.
